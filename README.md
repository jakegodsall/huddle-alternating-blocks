## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- BEM
- Sass
- 7-1 Sass Architecture

### What I learned

During this project I have learned how to better define my blocks and elements using BEM, resulting in code that is far more modular. For example, with the three feature blocks, I was able to define a `.feature-block` _block_, and then used _modifiers_ to change the order of image and text content `.feature-block--reverse`.

I have also learned to give a `max-width` and `margin-inline: auto` to a parent `<div>` in order to control the flow of the document at larger viewports.
